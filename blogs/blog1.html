  <p>Hello and welcome to my blog. I’m a Computer Science student who is currently home after completing their first year at the University of Kent.</p>

  <p>Before I start writing whatever comes to my mind, I should probably mention what this blog is, and future ones,
  are going to be about. The main reason I have decided to create blog posts is to reflect on my progress and learning.
  Maybe by taking a look at my blog, it may inspire you to continue doing what you’re doing, and maybe motivate you to write one yourself.</p>

  <p>I will soon be going into my second year of University, and I believe it is very important to not stop programming.
  As a result of this, I have recently started developing Android applications. If you can consider completing a
  Udacity course as developing apps. Although, hopefully, this course will give the foundations to begin developing
  more complex applications. Throughout my first year of University we were introduced to the Java programming language
  and Object Oritentated Programming concept. Ideally, by working on Android applications I’d like to develop my understanding of Java programming.</p>

  <p>I have a few ideas for simple, basic, applications I would like to start working on, and hope to have completed
  before continuing University this September.  Furthermore, at University I will be looking to find a
  third-year work placement, where I’ll go out into the work and work for a year, hopefully as a software
  developer. Seeing that someone has developed a few Android apps in their spare time and has somewhat
  of a Github portfolio will maybe impress an employer, or at least put them ahead of the competition.</p>

  <p>In my next blog, I will be talking about my current progress on the Udacity course I
  previously mentioned. At some point I will also create a post discussing what I did
  during my first year of University.</p>

  <p>Thanks, for reading.</p>
