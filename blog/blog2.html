    <h1>First year of University</h1>

    <h3>

      <p>Hello,</p>

      <p>In this blog post, I will be discussing my first year of University as a
        Computer Science student. For a little background information, I had recently
        completed a computer networking college course, similar to a BTEC, which
        was the equivalent to 3A Levels. I came out with the grades D*D* for the
        main course, A for an extended project qualification, and a C for AS Mathematics.
      </p>

      <p> Firstly, I will mention the modules I had undertaken, which were
        mandatory for all first-year students.</p>


        <p>Autumn Term </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduction to Object Orientated Programming</li>
          <li>Computer Systems</li>
          <li>Human Computer Interaction</li>
          <li>Foundations of Computing I</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Spring</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Further Object-Orientated Programming</li>
          <li>People and Computing</li>
          <li>Foundations of Computing II</li>
          <li>Databases and the Web</li>
        </ul>


        <p> During the first year, I had 8 modules. 5 of which consisted of 50% coursework,
          and 50% exam. The other 3 modules consisted of 100% coursework. </p>

          <p><u>Introduction to Object Orientated Programming</u></p>

          <p>Let’s talk about the first module – Introduction to Object Orientated Programming.
            Overall, this was a very enjoyable module, even if you had no prior programming
            experience.This module consisted of learning the basics of the Java programming
            language, and the object orientated programming model. This module consisted
            of three assignments, which got gradually harder, and an in-class programming
            test. The modules lectures consisted of teaching topics out of the book
            Objects First with Java by David Barnes (the lecturer). Every week we would
            be given a task to complete which would relate to a particular topic in the
            book, which was then assessed in a weekly class. The class material
            contributed 20% of the grade, while the three assignments and class test
            attributed the other 80%. </p>

            <p>As the course of the module went on, more features of the Java programming
              language were introduced. Loops were introduced (for loops, for-each, while)
              , collections (sets and maps), inheritance, recursion. </p>

              <p>The first assignment tasked you with simply defining a class with a constructor,
                simple fields, accessor methods, mutator methods, etc. In hindsight,
                this first assignment was simply an introduction to the assignment format
                and the rules and guidelines surrounding them, such as no plagiarising code or sharing code.</p>

                <p>The second assignment was a little more complicated.
                  The assignment contained tests which at the start all fail,
                  and you were responsible for fixing them, and creating a fully
                  functional program. This assignment was mainly testing your
                  knowledge of collections, such as array lists and hash maps.
                </p>

                <p>The third assignment was entirely focused on inheritance.
                  You were responsible converting a program to use inheritance
                  rather than the existing method.</p>

                  <p>The final assessment for this module was the in-class assessment.
                    For this, you were given information on functionality they want
                    from a program, and it is your job to implement it within two
                    hours, with only the help of the course book, and search
                    engines. You were however, allowed to look at the Java API,
                    and previous work you have done. This exercise was fun,
                    as it put your skills to the test, and truly shows how
                    good you are without using StackOverflow for all your errors.</p>

                    <p>
                      In conclusion, this module gave me a great foundation of
                      the Java programming language and the object orientated
                      programming model.
                    </p>

                    <p><u>Computer Systems</u></p>

                    <p>Moving onto the second module, Computer Systems. This
                      module aimed to provide an undestanding of the fundamental
                      behaiour and components of a typical computer system. Coming
                      from computer networking course, I already had a very solid
                      understanding of a computer system, so this module was relatively easy.

                    </p>

                    <p>This module covered various topics, starting with operating
                      systems, then networking, and finally computer architecture.
                      Although I was quite knowledgeably of some topics, it was
                      nice to be given a deeper look of things such as kernels,
                      paging systems, file systems work, to name a few.

                    </p>For this module, it was 50% exam and 50% coursework. The
                    coursework portion consisted of 4 online quizzes which were
                    ridiculously easy and poorly put together.

                    <p>
                    </p>

                    <p>The exam for this module tested knowledge entirely from the lectures and
                      was relatively easy if you understood the contents. What was challenging,
                      however, was the amount of content covered, and only being able to predict
                      what will be present in the exam based on past papers from previous years.
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Human Computer Interaction</u></p>

                    <p>This module was revered as the by far the worst of the eight by the majority
                      of students. From the title, it sounds rather interesting. How do we as
                      humans interact with computers? However, It felt like this module was
                      something you’d expect to see in a psychology course, it didn’t really
                      feel like computer science. I’d be lying if I didn’t find this module
                      useful though. To give you an understanding of the structure of the module,
                      we covered HCI guidelines and principles, qualitative evaluation methods,
                      interaction styles, lo-fi prototyping, quantitation evaluation methods,
                      features of human memory, errors and feedback, and security authentication.
                    </p>


                    <p>The reason why so many students disliked this particular module was due
                      to it being almost entirely group-based coursework. Although working within
                      a group is an important skill, you will inevitably be grouped with someone
                      who will contribute very little to the project.
                    </p>


                    <p>The first assignment tasked a group with going out into the world and observe
                      what people are doing, and why they’re doing it. Again, seems more like a
                      psychology thing. Then, present a presentation of your findings.

                    </p>


                    <p>Where the module began to get exciting was when we began working with
                      interfaces and prototyping, and then analysing them. The second assignment
                      tasked you with analysing an interface you use on a daily basis. Using the
                      methods taught in the lectures to evalulate them. This was rather interesting
                      as it allows you to see how an interface violates a HCI guideline.  This
                      was great because it allowed us to put what we had learnt to the test. I
                      had chosen to evaluate the iOS Spotify interface, and it was very eye-opening
                      to what heuristics such a popular and widely used application violates.
                    </p>


                    <p>For the final assignment, we were responsible for designing an interface for
                      an application. This was interesting because we had to attempt to allow for
                      functionality, but avoid breaking design heuristics.
                    </p>


                    <p>The exam portion was interesting as instead of simply regurgitating the
                      contents of the lectures, we had to draw an interface within the exam. So
                      while some questions were simply knowledge you’ve obtained from lectures,
                      some questions put your knowledge to the test by tasking you to create an
                      interface for a particular purpose with heuristics in mind.

                    </p>

                    <p><u>Foundations of Computing I</u></p>
                    
                    <p>The final module of the autumn term is Foundations of Computing I. This
                      module was entirely mathematics based and was introduced to us as a cross
                      between GCSE and A-level topics. The module consisted of statistics,
                      computer arithmetic, proof, set theory. A lot of students who had studied
                      A-level Mathematics had found this module relatively easy, I,  however,
                      had not covered the majority of topics previously.
                    </p>

                    <p>I had found this module the most enjoyable of the first term, as it was
                      very satisfying to learn a new mathematical concept such as proof, or set
                      theory, and actually be able to answer rather difficult questions.
                    </p>

                    <p>Once again this module was 50% exam, 50% coursework.
                      The coursework portion was interesting as we given a set of
                      questions which we had to complete over a week, kind of like
                      homework, but it was graded and contributed to your overall grade.
                      The problem with this approach is that you could often find answers
                      online for the majority of questions, and it was very easy to conversate
                      with friends about the answers to some questions.
                    </p>

                    <p>Since this blog post is already rather long, and probably nobody is reading
                      at this point, I’m going to end it here and discuss the spring term modules
                      in another post, and I will also mention my grades for each module.

                    </p>

                    <p>Thanks for reading! </p>
